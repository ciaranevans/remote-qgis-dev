# Remote QGIS development

This repo is for an experiment using [Remote Containers](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/containers) to separate out a development environment for making QGIS plugins.

It's expected that if this works, it will be adopted as a go-to solution for Python app development as it helps manage not only dependencies but OS level configuration too.
